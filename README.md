# ToDo_List

in this project i get help from this webside : https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-crud-operations-in-javascript-by-building-todo-app/

it is basically a to-do list which used CRUD operations. you can add, edit or delete tasks to do.
I was going to do it on my own but it would be more than learning somethings new,
just practicing and repeating myself so i have deciced to do it with a guide.
which help me to learn basics of bootstrap and JSON thats why im happy my decision.
